# Topic-Modelling

The objective is to extract meaningful topics using two different topic modelling approaches: LDA and BERTopic. Also identify thematic structures within the movie synopses and compare the topics generated by the traditional method (LDA) with those produced by the more recent, embedding-based method (BERTopic).
